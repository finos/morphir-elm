[Morphir](https://github.com/finos/morphir) is a multi-language system built on a data format that captures an
application's domain model and business logic in a technology agnostic manner. This repo contains tools that
allow you to write your business logic in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), parse it into Morphir IR and transpile
it to other languages like [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) or visualize it to your business users using Elm.

We publish it both as an NPM and an Elm package:

![Package Overview](docs/assets/package-overview.png)

- The [NPM package](#npm-package) contains the CLI for running the tools as part of your build.
- The [Elm package](#elm-package) supports multiple use-cases:
  - It includes SDK functions that you can use while writing your business logic beyond the default `elm/core` support.
  - It provides a type-safe API to work with the Morphir IR directly. You can use this to add your own logic builder,
    visualization or language transpiler.
  - It also provides access to the frontend that parses the Elm source code and returns Morphir IR. You could use this
    to embed a business logic editor in your web UI.

# NPM package

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/morphir-elm.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/morphir-elm)

The **morphir-elm** NPM package provides a CLI to run the tooling.

## Installation

```
npm install -g morphir-elm
```

## Usage

All the features can be accessed through sub-commands within the `morphir-elm` command:

```
Usage: morphir-elm -f [options] [command]

Options:
  -v, --version  output the version number
  -h, --help     output usage information

Commands:
  make           Translate Elm sources to Morphir IR
  gen            Generate code from Morphir IR
  develop        Start up a web server and expose developer tools through a web UI
  help [cmd]     display help for [cmd]
```

Each command has different options which are detailed below:

### `morphir-elm make`

This command reads Elm sources, translates to Morphir IR and outputs the IR into JSON.

```
Usage: morphir-elm make [options]

Translate Elm sources to Morphir IR

Options:
  -p, --project-dir <path>  Root directory of the project where morphir.json is located. (default: ".")
  -o, --output <path>       Target file location where the Morphir IR will be saved. (default: "morphir-ir.json")
  -h, --help                output usage information
  -f, --fallback-cli        Use old cli make function - recommended (default: false)
```

**Important**: The command requires a configuration file called `morphir.json` located in the project
root directory with the following structure:

```
{
    "name": "My.Package",
    "sourceDirectory": "src",
    "dependencies" : ["a", "b"]
    "localDependencies" : ["a", "b"]
    "exposedModules": [
        "Foo",
        "Bar"
    ]
}
```

- **name** - The name of the package. The package name should be a valid Elm module name and it should be used as a
  module prefix in your Elm models. If your package name is `My.Package` all your module files should either be directly
  under that or in submodules.
- **sourceDirectory** - The directory where your Elm sources are located.
- **dependencies** - List of URI references to other IR files. Supports
  `file://`|`http://`|`https://`|`data://` protocols.

* **localDependencies** - List of relative paths to depending IRs. (for backwards compatibility), ex: `"../sibling-folder/morphir-ir.json"`

- **exposedModules** - The list of modules in the public interface of the package. Module names should exclude the
  common package prefix. In the above example `Foo` refers to the Elm module `My.Package.Foo`.

#### Examples

If you want to try the `make` command you can use the reference model we have under `tests-integration/reference-model`. Simply `cd` into the directory and run the command.

### `morphir-elm gen`

This command reads the JSON produced by `morphir-elm make` and generates code into the specified folder:

```
Usage: morphir-elm gen [options]

Generate code from Morphir IR

Options:
  -i, --input <path>              Source location where the Morphir IR will be loaded from. (default: "morphir-ir.json")
  -o, --output <path>             Target location where the generated code will be saved. (default: "./dist")
  -t, --target <type>             Language to Generate (Scala | SpringBoot | cypher | triples). (default: "Scala")
  -e, --target-version <version>  Language version to Generate. (default: "2.11")
  -c, --copy-deps                 Copy the dependencies used by the generated code to the output path. (default: false)
  -h, --help                      output usage information
```

#### Examples

If you want to try the `gen` command you can use the reference model we have under `tests-integration/reference-model`. Simply `cd` into the directory and run the command.

### `morphir-elm develop`

This command relies on the JSON produced by `morphir-elm make` and brings up a web server to browse the Morphir IR.

```
Usage: morphir-elm develop [options]

Start up a web server and expose developer tools through a web UI

Options:
  -p, --project-dir <path>  Root directory of the project where morphir.json is located. (default: ".")
  -h, --help                output usage information
```

#### Examples

If you want to try the `develop` server you can use the reference model we have under `tests-integration/reference-model`. Simply `cd` into the directory and run the command.

# Elm package

[![Latest version of the Elm package](https://reiner-dolp.github.io/elm-badges/finos/morphir-elm/version.svg)](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest)

The [finos/morphir-elm](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest) package
provides various tools to work with Morphir. It contains the following main components:

- The [Morphir SDK](#morphir-sdk) which provides the base set of types and functions that Morphir tools support
  out-of-the-box. (the SDK is a superset [elm/core](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest) with a few
  exceptions documented below)
- A type-safe API for the [Morphir IR](#morphir-ir) that allows you to create or inspect it.

## Installation

```
elm install finos/morphir-elm
```

## Morphir SDK

The goal of the `Morphir.SDK` module is to provide you the basic building blocks to build your domain model and
business logic. It also serves as a specification for backend developers that describes the minimum set of functionality
each backend implementation should support.

It is generally based on [elm/core/1.0.5](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/1.0.5/) and provides most of
the functionality provided there except for some modules that fall outside the scope of business knowledge modeling:
`Debug`, `Platform`, `Process` and `Task`.

Apart from the modules mentioned above you can use everything that's available in `elm/core/1.0.5` without importing
the `Morphir SDK`. The Elm frontend will simply map those to the corresponding type/function names in the Morphir SDK.

The `Morphir SDK` also provides some features beyond `elm/core/1.0.5`. To use those features you have to import the
specific `Morphir SDK` module.

## Morphir IR

The `Morphir.IR` module defines a type-safe API to work with Morphir's intermediate representation. The module
structure follows the structure of the IR. Here's a list of concepts in a top-down approach:

- [Distribution](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-Distribution) is the output
  of `morphir-elm make`. It represents a whole package with all of its dependencies.
- [Package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-Package) represents a set of
  modules that are versioned together.
- [Module](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-Module) is a container
  to group types and values.
- [Types](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-Type) allow you to describe
  your domain model.
- [Values](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-Value) allows you to
  describe your business logic.
- [Names](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-Name) provide a naming
  convention agnostic representation for all nodes that can be named: types, values, modules and packages. Names can be
  composed into hierarchies:
  - [path](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-Path) is a list of names
  - [qualifield name](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-QName) is a module path with a local name
  - [fully-qualifield name](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-FQName) is a package path with a qualified name
- [AccessControlled](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/finos/morphir-elm/latest/Morphir-IR-AccessControlled)
  is a utility to define visibility constraints for modules, types and values
